## About the Project

Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning is an open-source project that aims to develop a robust deep learning model for automatically detecting and classifying diseases in plants. This project is intended to help farmers and agriculture professionals identify plant diseases early, enabling timely intervention to prevent crop loss.

Key features:
- Deep learning model for plant disease detection.
- Pretrained models for easy deployment.
- User-friendly web or mobile application (if applicable).


### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x
